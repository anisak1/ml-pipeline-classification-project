# **End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline: Customer Churn Classification**

This project implements a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn using the well-known IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model comparison, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation, along with a modular code structure suitable for extension and deployment.

## **Project Goals**

- Build a fully reproducible ML workflow
- Demonstrate industry-standard practices for classification tasks
- Compare multiple machine learning algorithms
- Build feature engineering and preprocessing pipelines
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
- Export final model artifacts for deployment
- Provide clear notebooks and modular Python scripts
